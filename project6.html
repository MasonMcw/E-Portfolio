                <p> <h3>Introduction</h3> <br>

                    <p>
                        This project was deveolped through a dataset which can be found on kaggle which lookes at different features related to a car.
                        This started due to my interest in both car prices and features, especially as someone who is potentially looking to purchase
                        a car. This project is focused on developing an unsupervised learning model which looks at the relationships between two of the columns.
                        Being able to find potential relationships within the data especially in relevance to price could be a huge benefit especially when
                        looking to purchase a car. Below the development of both the code is dicussed further going through the steps requried to make this
                        unsupervised learning model. Addtionally seen below is the GitHub link having both the code and dataset used for this project:

                        Starting off the code begins through normal procedures by implementing the requested csv/excel document that was being used.
                        Then I moved forward to the data cleaning and preprocessing phase. I started by checking the string based columns in my dataset and
                        seeing the count of each unique string per column. Understanding that KMeans clustering is more useful for numerical values regardless, I 
                        decided to remove any of the categorical rows containing values with less than 500 rows. Ensuring that I would have a good amount of data per category.
                        After that I then removed any NA values which may be seen within the data. Proceeding to print the shape to see the amount of data that has changed
                        within the dataset. Then I proceeded to encode the categorical values switching them to numerical values so they would work in the model that I have
                        chosen. Then using the StandardScaler function within python I normalized the data adding the standarized data onto the end of the dataframe with an '_T'.
                        Then to prevent outliers I made sure to further get rid of more rows, to ensure that all of the data remained with -3 to 3 standard deviations from
                        the mean. I did this as using cluster means without normalized data heavily changes the finalized look of the visual, not creating an accurate visual representation.

                    <img src="img/portfolio/Portfolio6/Output1.png" class="img-responsive img-border1" alt="Output1" style="float: right;">
                </div><br>
            </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Next understanding that the number of clusters can change based on the data that is being tested or observed, I first developed a
                        function for optimising the number of clusters used for the kmeans cluster model. I did this creating a function that would develop
                        a graph to visually show an eblow graph which is efficient in determining the number of clusters that should be used. Developing this
                        function allows for the user to understand how many clusters to use in the next function for the best working model. The user can pick
                        this number of clusters by following the curve to the point where it almost bends and then starts to show a consistent decline. In the
                        example I have provided below it can be seen the the elbow bend appears to start at 3 clusters. This indicates that I should use 3 clusters
                        when comparing the values that I have entered. I would have made one function but this function allows the user to see the elbow and then determine
                        how many clusters are required before moving forward to the actual clustering function.
                    </p> <br>

                <div class="col-md-6 about-img-size" data-aos="fade-up">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/Portfolio6/ElbowGraph.png" class="img-responsive img-border" alt="SQL Output" />
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12 about-img-div" data-aos="fade-up">
                    <p> <br>
                        Finally, we have the actual model which shows the kmeans clustering model being used. Here I produced a function which requires
                        the input of the data, the features, and then the number of clusters. Then when the function is activated it will produce a graph
                        which will show the centroids that were determined which are shown as the red stars on the graph. Then it will have a corresponding
                        amount of colours to the centroids and will produce and image of the found groupings. In the graph attached below which looks at the features
                        of selling price and km_driven we can see there are three clusters in both of the bottom corners and top left corner of the graph. This centroids
                        are able to discover patterns such as maybe grouping the cheap cars with not a lot of km drive, cheaper cars with a lot of miles driven,
                        and finally more expensive cars with not a lot of km driven. This makes sense as the data contains lots of cars which have had multiple or one previosu owner.
                        This would mean that it would not really make sense to have both an expensive car with a lot of kilometers on it which can be seen by the lack of a centroid in
                        the top right portion of the graph. Overall, this machine learning model is helpful in discovering the underlying patterns which can be seen in the data.

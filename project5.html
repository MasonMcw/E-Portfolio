                <p> <h3>Introduction</h3> <br>

                    <p>
                        This project highlights my Microsoft PowerBI knowledge and use for data anlysis when looking at a dataset.
                        This project was focused on jobs in the data analytics industry and was presented to a class of students in a 
                        data analytics specialism. The goal of this assignment from our group's perspective other than to create a effective 
                        and interactable report was to gain insight into the data analytics job market. During the assignment my group and I decided 
                        to focus on three main aspets within the data and relate it to other columns to tell a story. The topics we choose to evaluate
                        were the work setting, the job sector, and the company size. Below I have included each of the pages that we included in the
                        presentation as well as what was said during the presentaiton, highlighting the information we found through the creation of these
                        graphs. Due to not having access to Microsoft PowerBI premium I have added picture for the website and the pbix file can
                        be found in the GitHub link below.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Work Setting</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                       Starting off with the first page which includes the work setting some interesting information can be seen right away. Looking
                       at the three graphics down the middle we can see that 66.29% of work places have an in-person work setting, 33.21% have a
                       remote work setting, and only 1.50% have a primarily hybrid work setting. 
                       <br><br>
                       Upon an intial view of the top right graph we can
                       see that in terms of salaris in-person pays the most on average followed by remote and than hybird. However, upon further inspection
                       looking at the specific job sectors in each work setting interesting information can be found. Firstly, looking at hybrid although
                       the lowest average salary we can see that it actually has one of the highest paying positions in Leadership and Management across all
                       of the work settings. This further inspection shows us that the average salary does not tell the whole story as across many different
                       work settings it is important to both understand what sector you want as well as what work setting you would want to understand the average
                       salary. 
                       <br><br>
                       Addtionally, we can also see in the bottom right the world map shows us that this data is primarily relative to North America and most of Europe
                       as this is where large circles of data can be seen as well as many clusters in Europe. This page helps the user to understand the different
                       impacts of work setting on salary, location, and job sector when looking into the data analytics workplace industry.

                    <h4>Job Sector</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The job sector analysis reveals trends that span across the differing experience levels, with a focus on the entry-level experience
                        level which serves as the first step for potential aspiring data analysts. 
                        <br><br>
                        The key entry-level sectors include Data Dcience, Data
                        Engineering, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning and AI, as these offer the most available positions in the market. Two of the sectors
                        which appear to have a lack of available entry level jobs are Data Architecture and Data Management which may suggest that more experience
                        is required for jobs in both of these sectors before entering them. 
                        <br><br>
                        Revieiwng the salary dynamics which can be observed it appears that Machine Learning and AI job sector is the most lucrative across
                        almost all of the experience levels, while being the second most for entry-level positions. Conversely to the Machine Learning and AI job sector,
                        the Data Analysis job sector, although having lots of available positions seems to have a relatively modest average salary across all
                        experience levels.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall this information that can be seen provides useful insights for fresh graduates in data and people trying to work their way into the data analytics
                        industry. Allowing them to understand the dynamic data landscape and choose a path based on their ambitions regarding salary and end experience level.

                    <br>
                    <h4>Company Size</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        In this page below it will be focused on the company size and the experience level of employees in data analytics jobs. 
                        Company size looks at companies that are small, medium and large. The experience level is signified by 
                        entry-level, mid-level, senior-level and executive level.
                        <br><br>
                        Looking at the salaries graph over the years it can be seen that large companies pay the most on average with 
                        medium sized companies slightly behind and smaller companies at the bottom by quite a large margin. 
                        However, although smaller companies pay the least, it would appear here on average when we click into the 
                        entry level distinction on the tree map (Interaction) we can see some interesting statistics. 
                        We can see more clearly that smaller companies have a higher percentage of available entry-level positions 
                        followed by larger companies. Additionally larger companies do not pay that much for entry levels compared to 
                        medium sized companies. Ideally this would mean that on average working for a medium sized company as an 
                        entry-level experience worker would pay the most.
                        <br><br>
                        Going through the mid-level and senior level positions (Interaction) it can be seen that large companies pay the most for 
                        these positions and have a similar percentage of jobs available, but there are much more medium companies overall 
                        as seen in the donut chart. The donut chat here can also be helpful in identifying that this dataset has a lot more 
                        medium sized jobs overall especially compared to large and small companies. 
                        Finally looking at the executive positions (Interaction) it can be seen that medium companies pay the most for 
                        these positions and executive positions are scare across the board for any company size.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, there are two career path suggestions that we could make in terms of making your way up to an executive position that pays a lot.
                        <br><br>
                        1. Hard time finding a job: We recommend to search for a position in a smaller company in an area they like to 
                        gain experience and understanding of the industry. From there we recommend moving around to large companies to 
                        gain a higher position and earn more pay.
                        <br>
                        2. Easily finding a job or connections: The second option is to initially work for a medium sized company and then 
                        work your way up within the company or move to a larger company for pay benefits, returning to a medium size 
                        company when you have the experience required to be an executive.

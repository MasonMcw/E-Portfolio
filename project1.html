                <h4>Visual Change #1</h4>
                <p>During my first year at Brock University I learned some basic visual manupilation coding. The first assignment
                that I will show was a basic code to implement "stars" into a pciture of an eagle infront of a harvest moon. The code was
                designed to create a random number of small stars which could either be small or large stars. Small stars would be one white
                pixel, while larger stars were 5 pixels. However, these stars were not supposed to show up on or infront of the tree, moon, or
                eagle. If the stars were randomly placed their they would be either slightly or fully obsecured depnding on size and palcement.
                Finally it would produce an output of both of the picture as well as how many small, large, obsecure and total stars were added 
                to the picture. Addtionally this was made in Thonny application, where I used the libraries known as image, random, distance, and
                math. Below I have added the original picture, the edited picture, and the output that shows all the stars information. If you
                want to see the coding of it please click the github link.

                <h4>Visual Change #2</h4>
                <p>Addtionally during this time at Brock University my final assignment was related to visual manipulation and application.
                    Essentially it was a two step assignment. The first step was to create functions that would allow the user to apply
                    a filter to a picture of their choosing. For my assignment I decided to choose the filters SepiaTone, Negative, GreyScale,
                    and an OnlyRed filter. I was able to do this through a loop which would manipulate the individual pixels, based on what 
                    the filter would want to do. The exact manipulations made in terms of coding can be seen in the github link with their 
                    respective functions. The next part was to put the images that the user created into a collage so that they could see all 
                    four of the pictures that were created. This code was designed to ask the user to place the pictures within a frame,
                    however it would tell the user if there was an error in the case of overlapping of photos. Addtionally it would say
                    which filter was applied to the pictures in the earlier section. Seen below I have attached pictures of both the original
                    images of both the bird and the volcano. Additionally I have added a sample of what the collage might have looked like, with
                    each picture showing which filter was applied.

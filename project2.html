                <p> <h3>Introduction</h3> <br>

                    <p>
                        This project was completed for one of my courses called Data Analytics for Marketing at Dublin City University and focused on the 
                        ideas of linear regression, and data story telling. The dataset used for this assignment was made by the professor and
                        utilized answers from a google form that each student had to complete. The professor gave the dataset to us exactly
                        as the students answered some questions, meaning the first steps were to clean the data of outliers. Additionally, I will
                        provide both the original document provided to us as well as the document me and my teammate used to complete the 
                        questions for the assignment in the GitHub link below. The first part of the assignment was to find the missing values that
                        the professor had highlighted in red and purposefully deleted. Solving this problem required the use of linear regression, based
                        on the other columns that were additionally present in the data. There were five values total, and each needed a unique regression, which
                        can be seen in part 1 below. The second aspect of this assignment was to connect the two separate sheets on the document using a VLOOKUP()
                        function (explained below), and to tell a story about the data. Me and my group mate took a very logical approach to this query and decided
                        to create a correlation matrix which would show us the statistical relationships between two columns of data. After finding some strong and
                        slightly weak relationships we then created scatterplot graphs to show the relationship and further explain and reinforce the story we aimed to tell
                        from the data. As mentioned previously the link to these documents can be found below as well as the actual submission for the assignment.

                <p> <h3>Age Value</h3> <br>
                    We discovered that the number of older and younger siblings significantly influenced the age value in the dataset. 
                    To prepare for regression analysis, we filtered out rows containing the missing age data and retained the values for 
                    younger and older siblings (2 and 0). After confirming that the Significance F and the P-value were both less than 0.05, 
                    we proceeded with the analysis. We used the regression formula, (18 + 1.8 * 2 + 1.7 * 0), and derived the missing age 
                    value as 22. We anticipated that the number of older and younger siblings would be influential on the age value since 
                    we believed that individuals with younger siblings might tend to be older, and vice versa.

                        <h3>CAO Points</h3><br>
                        Regarding the missing CAO point, we identified a significant association with the average year 1 exam marks. 
                        Following a similar procedure, we removed the row with missing CAO data and preserved the value of 66 for 
                        Average Year 1 results. Utilizing the formula (376 + 1.7 * 66), we determined the missing CAO to be 485.
                        We thought that the average year 1 exam result would be influential since individuals with higher grades may 
                        tend to perform better in their CAO assessments.

                    In our analysis of daily travel patterns, we discovered that age played a significant role in the dataset. 
                    Initially, we encountered difficulty identifying data points that strongly correlated with daily travel habits. 
                    It was unexpected to observe that age exhibited a correlation with daily travel behavior. 
                    To further explore this relationship, we repeated our procedures and employed the formula (-2.5 + 0.6 * 22), 
                    yielding a value of 10 for daily travel.

                        To derive the average year 1 exam results, we referenced the CAO row, recognizing its significance as we 
                        had previously utilized these same rows in calculating the CAO points. Employing the formula (58 + 0.02 * 600), 
                        we determined the absent exam result to be 71.

                        We believed their relevance stemmed from their potential influence on personalities. 
                        Following familiar procedures, we applied the formula (4.5 + 0.18 * 2), 
                        resulting in the determination of the missing seat row as 5.

                    <h4>Part 2 (Story Telling From Data)</h4>
                    <p>
                        To merge the demographics and personalities datasets, we employed the VLOOKUP() function to pair data points sharing
                        identical last four mobile digits. Subsequently, we refined the dataset by eliminating outliers and entries lacking
                        matching mobile numbers. After careful normalisation, we curated a total of 65 datapoints deemed to be in a 
                        standardised format. These datasets formed the basis for our exploration into identifying correlations and patterns.
                        <br><br>
                        First, we compared all our standardised data to see how they related to each other using the RSQ() 
                        formula on excel. When two sets of data matched perfectly, showing a 100% correlation, we marked those spots. 
                        Then, we used colours to show which data points were more strongly linked, highlighting correlations 
                        between 0.3 and 0.7 in green. Even weaker correlations, between 0.1 and 0.3, got our attention too, and 
                        we made sure to look into those as well, these were highlighted in yellow. This way, we could easily spot 
                        where our data seemed to be connected and how strongly.

                            The correlations identified as green weren't surprising. When reviewing the highly correlated data points 
                            it made sense that the areas were correlated based on basic human knowledge and physical trends or attributes. 
                            The main areas of higher correlation stemmed between height, weight, gender, and shoe size. When considering 
                            all of the factors together you can see that it would make sense, for example a male might be taller which makes
                            him by default heavier and have a larger shoe size. Overall, these correlations were not very interesting but 
                            felt important to note that this data still showed a simple consistency revolving physical features.

                        Intriguing patterns appeared when the correlations highlighted in yellow were examined. 
                        Notably, we discovered a link between assertiveness and average first-year exam outcomes. 
                        Assertive people tend to be more confident and sociable than those who are more reserved or turbulent. 
                        This finding implies a possible link between assertiveness and academic achievement, since assertive persons 
                        may be more likely to request explanation, engage in proactive learning activities, and establish supportive 
                        social networks in educational environments. Such dynamics may contribute to improved academic performance, 
                        providing important insights into the relationship between personality traits and academic achievement.

                            There is a slight link between extraversion and intuition. Our outcomes indicate that people with higher 
                            degrees of intuition emphasise present-focused attention and depend more on their emotions when making 
                            decisions. Observant people, on the other hand, usually think long and hard before making a decision. 
                            This link with extraversion is most likely due to extroverts' extroverted and easygoing personalities. 
                            As a result, intuitive people who succeed at living in the now and avoiding excessive ruminating may 
                            exhibit extraversion-related features.

                            Reviewing the correlation between thinking and assertiveness, it was found that there was a weak correlation. 
                            We believe that there is a potentially higher correlation if there were more data points as it would make 
                            sense that the people who do more thinking over feeling would be assertive. Because of the nature of a thinker, 
                            it stands to reason that they have confidence in their ideas and plans as a result of the recurrence of 
                            thinking about them in their heads.This would cause thinkers to be more assertive because, rather than 
                            considering other people's feelings and opinions, they would be more assertive in ensuring that their own 
                            concept is right. This would add up if someone was in the position of having both a thinking and feeling 
                            personality, as they would most likely also be in the middle of assertiveness, as indicated in the graph to the right.

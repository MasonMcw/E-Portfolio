                <p> <h3>Introduction</h3> <br>

                    <p>
                        This project was thought of based on my interest on data and cryptocurrencies. This project is focused on working
                        with the website Coin Market Cap which can be seen in the media section. The whole goal of this project was to create
                        a code that would be able to first ask the user which cryptocurrencies they would like to know about. Then from there
                        the data would be converted to a SQL database where the information can be viewed. This project turned out quite well,
                        other than the input having to be entered in a specific way. The data is entered seamlessly through the whole process and
                        then ends in the SQL database where further analysis can be conducted. Below I have added both the full python code in a py file,
                        as well as examples for the potential SQL analysis formulas on a word document into GitHub.

                    <h4>Code Run Through</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Starting off the code starts by asking the user to input which cryptocurrencies they would like to view or analyze. 
                        The input has to be entered in a specific way in terms of spacing and commas so that the names can then be used to 
                        get the information from Coin Market Cap online. After the input is added in, it will convert the entire list to all lowercase no matter 
                        what they enter and add a '-' in between cryptocurrencies that are multiple words. This method is to retrieve the crypto 
                        through the slug format, which is all lowercase with the '-' in between spaces. Please see below an example of an input for the code:
                    </p> <br>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6 about-img-size" data-aos="fade-up">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/Portfolio4/input.png" class="img-responsive img-border" alt="Code Input" />
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6 about-img-div" data-aos="fade-up">
                    <p><br><br>
                        Seen above we can see that a long list of coins was added including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, BNB ,Solana, XRP,
                        Litecoin, Dogecoin, Toncoin, Cardano, Avalanche, Shiba Inu, Bitcoin Cash, Polkadot, Tron, and finally error coin1.
                        I purposefully entered 'error coin1' to show the reaction of the code if a coin which is not recognized is entered or
                        if the input is not done correctly. On the right here the ouput of what is printed to the user is shown. It first states all
                        of the crypto currencies which the code was not able to access and then continues on to say please check spelling and formatting
                        to ensure the coin is added into the database. Then it will print out the entire list of cryptocurrencies which have been 
                        successfully added into the SQL database. The output will complete with stating that the data has been successfully added into the data base.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6" data-aos="fade-up"><br><br>
                    <img src="img/portfolio/Portfolio4/output.png" width="600" class="img-responsive img-border1" alt="align"="right" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="0" />

            </div>

                    <p>
                        Moving forward to explain the SQL portion of it. The user will have to first create a database in their respective
                        SQL platform. In this case I have created an SQL database called 'CryptoAnalysis' and I am using Postgre for my server
                        of choice. The first action will be to drop any existing tables with the potential name 'cryptocurrencies' and to ensure
                        that the new table only contains relevant and the most recent data requested. Following that it will move to create a 
                        new table with the name 'cryptocurrencies' with all the related columns in a float format. This is because many of the 
                        values can be either very large or extremely small making precision hard to achieve in terms of classfiying the values.
                        Then using the connection it will begin to insert the values that were aquired for each successfully listed cryptocurrency
                        into the table created. This is also when it will say that the cryptocurrencie has been successfully added as seen above.
                        Finally, the connection to the database will close or it will produce and error if the connection was unsuccessful.
                        Please see below the database that was created in SQL Postgre after the code's completion. 
                    </p> <br>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6 about-img-size" data-aos="fade-up">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/Portfolio4/sqloutput.png" class="img-responsive img-border" alt="SQL Output" />
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12 about-img-div" data-aos="fade-up">
                    <p> <br>
                        Finally, although this is not the full scale of the table as I could not fit the entire table on one screen, it
                        shows how it is much easier to view the information now and it is all easily accessible. Addtionally through the
                        commands that I have suggested and listed in the SQL word document found in the GitHub link users are able to further
                        analysis the data based on what information they would want to know. Although the commands provided are not the only ways
                        to manipulate and view the data they are some methods which might be common for the user to use to view the data.

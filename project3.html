            <br>
                <p> <h3>Introduction</h3> <br>

                    <p>
                        This project was developed around a dataset found on kaggle that looks at airline customer satisfaction. Understanding
                        that customer satisfaction is such a key role in the business world and I have a love for the airline industry this dataset
                        seemed very relevant to use and study. When looking at the dataset I decided I wanted to create a supervised learning model
                        which would look at all of the columns and then be able to tell if the customer was left either 'satisfied' or 'neutral or dissatisfied'.
                        Below I will dicuss how I was able to make this model and some addtional features which I was able to add on for visual purposes.
                        I have also attached the link to the GitHub page containing both the code for this document and the excel file that was used:

                        Starting off the code begins through normal procedures by implementing the requested csv/excel document that was being used.
                        Then I moved forward to the data cleaning and preprocessing phase. I started off by dropping the NA values within the dataset and
                        had a feedback bar which said how many rows were deleted and showed the before and after amount of rows. This was to make sure that
                        there was still a lot of data which could be trained and tested to make a more accurate model. I also dropped both the unanmed id column
                        as well as the customer review id as these columns have no actual relationship to the overall customer satisfaction. Finally, I encoded
                        the categorical data so that it could also be used in the analysis assocaiting each one with a number starting at 0 and then adding one per each
                        unique category value/string.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Then I proceeded to create the machine learning algorithm which would be a random forest classifier. I started off by splitting the data
                        into both the features (X) and the target variable (Y). Then I used the Standard Scaler function to normalize the data so it would be easier to use
                        and work better in the model. Then as standard I split the models into the respective training and testing models for X and Y. The next step
                        was to train the random forest classifier using the training variables previously created. This section I used the standard number of n_estimators
                        which is 100 and set the random state to 42 which are both the built in standard amounts for this model. 
                        Finally for the model I made the predictions and then printed the accuracy of
                        the model which was 0.96 which is really good. This means that on average based on the customer reviews the model would be able to tell whether or not
                        the customer left satisified, only having an error about 4% of the time. Addtionally I construcuted a clasification report which was able to further
                        show the strength of my model looking at the precision, recall, and f1 score. Looking at the classifcation report below mainly in the recall, it shows
                        that my model, although efficient, often predicts more 'neutural or dissatisfied', showing a lower value in satisfied meaning it predicted more false negatives.
                        Which makes sense inversly why 'neutural or dissatisfied' is 0.97 in recall vs the 0.93 in 'satisfied'.

                    <p> <br>
                        Finally, I wanted to understand each of the features importance in terms of understanding this supervised learning model. This
                        part of the code would be very useful for people working in the industry with this data to understand the biggest factors which
                        go towards whether a customer leaves 'satisfied' or 'neutural or dissatisfied'. This requires first using the features importances function
                        to discover which features have the most importance and then sorting them in terms of their importance. Next I made a horizontal bar
                        graph to create a visual which would do an easy job showing the order of importance and adding a visual aspect to their importance in terms
                        of how big the bar for that feature was. Looking at the graph below we can see that the online boarding, inflight wifi service,and class were
                        the top three features for importance for this model. While depature delay in minutes, food and drink, and gender seemed to be at the bottom in terms of importance.
                        This is helpful for airlines to understand what features need to be focused on in terms of improvement, letitng them know what they can change to
                        create more satisfied customers on their flights.

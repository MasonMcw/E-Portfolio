                <p> <h3>My Hobbies</h3> <br>
                    Starting off with my hobbies. I am very interested in a couple things, however mainly I love to do physical activities in my spare time.
                    In terms of my background, I have always been a very active person. During most of my life I was a competitive swimmer and I was a varsity
                    athlete for Brock University during my first two years of school before continuing my dual-degree at Dublin City University. Swimming took
                    up a majority of my time through my youth and the beginning of University, averaging about nine two hour practices a week. However, although
                    I do not swim anymore I have kept up continuing physical activities. When coming to Dublin City University I joined the Ultimate Frisbee Club
                    and although I practiced a lot less with them it was a lot of fun and something new! Overall, I look to find any physical activity I can do in my free time to both 
                    maintain a good state of physical and mental health.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, another activity which I participate in with my friends is an investment competition which is on Investopedia.
                    This competition can last as long as you want, we usually do it in yearly increments. The game gives each player an initial capital to work with.
                    Our games we usually give about 10,000 dollars for each player. Then using the information and research that Investopedia provides on the site, 
                    you can see the all the different stocks and the goal is to obviously gain the highest return by completion of the games time limit. Through
                    this game I have witnessed a higher degree of bigger risk bigger reward. Understanding that it's a year-long you can either take a risky aggressive approach
                    with stocks you expect to jump quickly, or you can take the safe route and invest in a stock that is likely to rise even if it is by a minimal amount such as
                    the top companies in the Fortune 500. The aggressive approach can help you achieve a huge lead on the competitors, however obviously if the
                    stock you go for drops, then most of your initial capital will be diminished. This game is lots of fun while additionally educational in
                    showing the way different styles of investing can be both beneficial and disadvantageous.

                        <h3>Volunteer Work</h3><br>
                        Continuing with my volunteer work, I volunteered mostly when I was younger as a personal support worker at
                        Lighthouse Learning. Lighthouse Learning is a special therapy and support service that supports children who have
                        autism. My passion to help at Lighthouse Learning stemmed from reading a book called Fragile Bones by
                        Lorna Schultz Nicholson. This book revolves around the struggles that a 15-year-old boy faces with high functioning autism
                        and the relationships he makes during his years in education. This book educated me on the issues that children and people with
                        autism face and I wanted to show my support where I could. After reading the book I discussed with my mom my ambition to help people
                        who face struggles due to autism. That's when she connected me with the head of Lighthouse Learning and I volunteered my time to helping out
                        the children during the summer camp so they could have the best time possible. This experience overall enlightened me on the specific difficulties
                        that some of these children faced day to day, but also showed me the amazing things they are capable of if people give them a chance. Overall,
                        I would recommend anyone who wants to help out to volunteer their time and support people in their community to gain the satisfaction of 
                        seeing them enjoy themselves!
